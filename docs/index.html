    <h1>AlexScript to JavaScript (as2js)</h1>
    <p>
      I'll need to work on this page as time goes... my idea is to have the
      high level documentation here. There is also a page at
      <a href="https://as2js.com/">http://www.as2js.com/</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The as2js compiler is to be used to compile advanced JavaScript into
      JavaScript that works in any modern browser. The idea is to use the
      an advanced set of syntactic enhancements to the language such as
      adding support for operator overloading to classes and as part of
      the compiler having ways to optimize the output as much as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another strong change to the original language is to have a strong
      typing to variables (not mandatory, though.) This is useful to increase
      code security (i.e. by avoiding many otherwise difficult to find bugs.)
    </p>
    <p>
      At this point the project is in limbo as I've not been able to find
      time to work on it. Plus with ES6 and ES7 coming out, it's certainly
      behind (i.e. no support for arrow functions, for example.) However,
      the JSON implementation works great and is used in
      <a href="https://snapwebsites.org/">Snap! C++</a>.
