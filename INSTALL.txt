To compile and install as2js from source:

IMPORTANT: since this is now part of Snap! C++ you want to use the
           bin/build-snap script instead (after cloning snapcpp from
	   github)

  . Download the source
  . tar xf as2js.tar.gz
  . mkdir BUILD
  . cd BUILD
  . cmake ../as2js-0.1.0      # fix version as required
  . make
  . sudo make install

cmake can be tweaked with different flags as follow:

  cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=/home/snapwebsites/BUILD/dist \
	-DCMAKE_MODULE_PATH:PATH=/home/snapwebsites/BUILD/dist/share/cmake-3.5/Modules \
	../as2js

You may also change the installation path to /usr to install in the standard
Unix environment.

The project requirements:

  . cmake
  . snapCMakeModules
  . g++
  . murmur3
  . libexcept
  . libutf8
  . versiontheca
  . snapdev (compile time only)
  . snapcatch2 (to run the tests)
  . doxygen/graphviz (to extracts docs)
