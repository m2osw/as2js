<h1>Function</h1>
<p>JavaScript functions are quite limited. In JavaScript you cannot
overload functions, nor catch() statements. as2js offers such extensions
to make it transparent to the end user and thus make it a lot easier
to handle complex classes with as little work as possible for the end
users.</p>
<pre>
<em>attribute</em> function <em>name</em> ( <em>parameter list</em> )
	: <em>type</em>
	throws <em>expression</em>, ...
	require <em>label</em> : <em>expression</em>, ...
	require else <em>label</em> : <em>expression</em>, ...
	ensure <em>label</em> : <em>expression</em>, ...
	ensure then <em>label</em> : <em>expression</em>, ...
{
	... <em>body statements</em> ...
}
</pre>
<h2>Functions</h2>
<p>Functions support many attributes. Some of the attributes are specific
to function members and are only listed in the class definition. Attributes
that are available to global functions are defined here:</p>
<ul>
	<li>internal -- the function represents an internal function, a function that's intrinsic to the JavaScript language</li>
	<li>native -- the function member is a native function, a function that's intrinsic to the JavaScript language</li>
	<li>inline -- the function member should be inlined anywhere it is called</li>
	<li>array -- ???</li>
	<li>deprecated -- the function member should not be used as it was marked <em>deprecated</em></li>
	<li>unsafe -- the function member is not considered safe (i.e. eval() is marked unsafe)</li>
	<li>unused -- the function member cannot be used</li>
	<li>true -- conditional compilation, the function is compiled in</li>
	<li>false -- conditional compilation, the function is ignored</li>
</ul>
<p>Another drawback of regular JavaScript code is that variables are
scoped at a function level only if declared with the var keyword.
Other variables are viewed as globals, which in a browser means a
member of the window object. With as2js, we fixed that. Variables
used inside a function are viewed as local by default. Not only
that, blocks of statements prevent sharing of variables. So defining
a variable in a block does not make it available in the entire function
unless it was previously defined outside of both blocks.</p>
<p>This new concept, for general JavaScript programmers, would
create many bugs, though. To avoid most of them as2js will generate
errors if you try to access an undefined variable. It will also
generate a warning in case you shadow a variable with another. This
should make it easy to find many bugs where a variable is used
before being initialized or after it went out of scope.</p>
<pre>
function foo()
{
	var visible_in_whole_function := "all";

	// the following prints "all" in your console
	console.log(visible_in_whole_function);

	{
		var visible_in_this_block := 3;

		// the following prints "3" in your console
		console.log(visible_in_this_block);

		// the following prints "all" in your console
		console.log(visible_in_whole_function);

		{
			var visible_in_this_block := 5; // warning: variable "visible_in_this_block" shadows a previous definition at <em>line number</em>

			// the following prints "5" in your console
			console.log(visible_in_this_block);
		}

		// the following prints "3" in your console
		console.log(visible_in_this_block);
	}

	{
		// the following prints "undefined" in your console
		console.log(visible_in_this_block); // error: undefined variable "visible_in_this_block"

		// the following prints "all" in your console
		console.log(visible_in_whole_function);
	}

	// valid in regular JavaScript, fails in as2js:
	if(expression)
	{
		i = 123;
	}
	else
	{
		i = 456;
	}
	console.log(i); // error: undefined variable "i"
}
</pre>
<h2>Return Type: expression</h2>
<p>Function declarations are expected to include a type definition.
The type appears after a colon appearing right after the list of
parameters of the function. In most cases the type is an expression
which represents the name of a type such as the name of a class
(i.e. <code>function foo() : Native.String</code> is expected to
return a <strong>String</strong>.) Note that any functions may
return the special value <strong>null</strong> or
<strong>undefined</strong> even if they define a type such as
<strong>String</strong>. This is because anything a function may
return is ultimately represented by the <strong>Object</strong>
type and objects can be <strong>null</strong> or
<strong>undefined</strong>.</p>
<h2>Return Type: Void</h2>
<p>Functions can be marked as returning <strong>Void</strong>. This
is similar to creating a procedure. The function can use the return
keyword, but only without an expression. Vice versa, any function
that does not return <strong>Void</strong> must use the return
keyword with an expression of the right type.</p>
<h2>Return Type: Never</h2>
<p>Functions support a special return type named <strong>Never</strong>.
When a function return type is setup to <strong>Never</strong>, the
function cannot return. It has to have an infinite loop. It may,
however, use the throw keyword. Note that in JavaScript in a browser
you should never really have such a function.</p>
<p>IMPORTANT NOTE: The case is important.</p>
<h2>Exceptions: Throws</h2>
<p>You may define a list of exceptions that the function will
eventually throw. At this time, it is not used, but we may be
able to optimize certain things by having that information.
Note that the list is not expected to be exhaustive. The list
are expressions separated by commas, each of which represents
a type that is used to throw an exception.</p>
<h2>Contract: require and ensure</h2>
<p>A function can be assigned two sets of contracts:
<strong>require</strong> contracts, which is expected to check the
input parameters validity, and <strong>ensure</strong> contracts,
which are expected to verify the validity of the object when exiting
the function.</p>
<p>The require and ensure are used with one label and an expression,
to enter more than one contract, enter another label and expression
after a comma.</p>
<p>When you extend a class and overload a function, you cannot use
<strong>require</strong> and <strong>ensure</strong> as is. Instead
you have to use <strong>require else</strong> and
<strong>ensure then</strong> which means the existing contracts are
extended.</p>
<pre>
  require: REQUIRE contract_list
  require_else: REQUIRE ELSE contract_list
  ensure: ENSURE contract_list
  ensure_then: ENSURE THEN contract_list
  contract_list: contract
               | contract_list ',' contract
  contract: IDENTIFIER ':' expression
