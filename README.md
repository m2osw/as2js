## C++ AlexScript to JavaScript compiler

The Snap! C++ environment includes this advanced JavaScript compiler which
allows you to transform AS-like scripts, using "interface", "class",
"public", "private", "protected", and many other additional keywords, and
transform that in prototype definitions as supported by browsers.

Also provided is the `as2js` binary. This tool is the as2js compiler, which accepts
as input Advanced JavaScript that looks like classes, interfaces, etc. and compiles
that in objects that can be reused by your browser with namespaces, functions, and prototypes.
