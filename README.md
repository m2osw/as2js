# as2js: Advanced JavaScript Compiler

## C++ AlexScript to JavaScript compiler

The Snap! C++ environment includes this advanced JavaScript compiler which
allows you to transform AS-like scripts, using "interface", "class",
"public", "private", "protected", and many other additional keywords, and
transform that in prototype definitions as supported by browsers.

Also provided is the `as2js` binary. This tool is the `as2js` compiler,
which accepts as input Advanced JavaScript that looks like classes,
interfaces, etc. and compiles that in objects that can be reused by
your browser with namespaces, functions, and prototypes.


# Documentations

The [ECMAScript](https://www.ecma-international.org/) documentation is the
most current source.

Our implementation extends a few things (operators, classes, etc.) and
outputs code that browsers can support as is.
